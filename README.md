# 42SH

42sh is a 42 school project whose goal is to make a POSIX shell.

But the most important aspect of this project was to work on our ability to contribute to a big project in a group. We deviated from a base of mine but the project was a contribution of [Jeremi Raymond](https://github.com/jraymond96), [Sebastien Le Rest](https://github.com/SLeRest), [Gaetan Dufay](https://github.com/gdufay) and me [Mohammed Merabet](https://github.com/mmerabet42), we each worked on different aspect of the project but my main duty was to make all the abstraction and the genericity of a system that should simplify the addition of new features.
